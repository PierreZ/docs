To access your manager, your first need to order a Metrics product.


## Metrics Manager
Let's have a quick tour on the Manager. It's located in the [cloud section](https://www.ovh.com/manager/cloud/index.html){.external} under Metrics section (available when you subscribed a Metrics product).

Here you can grab two defaults read and write tokens. You can use them or decide to create new ones.

Once done, click to the Platforms tab.
