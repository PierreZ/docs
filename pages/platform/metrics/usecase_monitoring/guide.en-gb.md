## Monitoring?
From an historical point of view, timeseries appeared shortly after the creation of the Web, **to help engineers monitor the networks.** It quickly expands to also monitors servers.

Supervision involves indicating and controlling the status of a call, system or network. Supervision solutions **help technical and functional information of the information system**. Since IT has become the backbone of the company, regardless of its sector, the information system is at the center of the different business entities and must function fully and continuously to ensure the efficiency of the company. At all levels, networks, user terminals, **application servers or data are becoming sensitive links that could harm the availability and quality of service or even the proper functioning of the company**.


## Why you should monitor?
Monitoring is one of the pillars of successful infrastructure. It has been called the base of the hierarchy of reliability. Monitoring is a must have for responding to incidents, detecting and debugging systemic problems, planning for the future, and generally understanding your infrastructure.

## Monitor your servers
The most basic form of monitoring is monitoring the server. By sending key metrics such as **cpu, ram, disk**, you can watch over the health of your servers. **Does one of my servers has a disk full?**

In fact, Systems like ["Apache mesos"](http://mesos.apache.org/){.external}, ["OpenStack"](https://www.openstack.org/){.external}, ["Kubernetes"](https://kubernetes.io/){.external} and others are heavily relying on time series to handle basic operations like **"what's the status of my virtual machine"**, or **"where should I deploy my container"**.

You can find numerous Open Source exporters to install on your servers, like:

- ["Scollector"](http://bosun.org/scollector/){.external}
- ["Telegraf"](http://bosun.org/scollector/){.external}
- ["Snap"](http://snap-telemetry.io/){.external}
- ["Beamium"](https://github.com/ovh/beamium){.external} and ["Noderig"](https://github.com/ovh/noderig){.external}
- ["StatsD"](https://github.com/etsy/statsd){.external}
- ["Collectd"](https://collectd.org/){.external}
